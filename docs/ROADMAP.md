# ROADMAP — from the MVP port to a fully implemented stack

Status: living document (written 2026-07). Describes where the port stands,
what is missing, and the ordered plan to close it. The invariants at the
bottom are **load-bearing** — every phase must preserve them.

## 1. Where we are

The foundation is proven and fast; the port itself is deliberately narrow.

**Proven (differential, against real `c2.dll`/`c1xx.dll` 16.00.11886.00 under wibo):**

- **P0.1** — standalone-c2 IL-bundle replay is byte-exact on all 25 fixtures
  (`c2rs replay`). The reference side of the differential is real.
- **P-F0.1** — standalone-c1 (front-end) replay is byte-exact on all 25
  fixtures (`c2rs replay-c1`). The same porting path is open for `c1xx.dll`.
- **The port (`c2-core::PortC2`) is byte-exact on the MVP class**
  (`c2rs diff`): straight-line integer add/sub/mul chains with immediate
  folding and wide constants, multi-function TUs of those, bare void tail
  calls, integer tail calls `return g(<arg>)` (passthrough / `+0` fold /
  arg-setup), and the framed non-leaf `return g(a) + k` (6-section obj with
  `.pdata`). Everything else returns `NotImplemented` — fail closed, never a
  guess.
- **Harness + tooling**: oracle self-test, corpus generator, obj→IL retrieval
  baseline, IL-space search prototype, edit gate; `perf`/`perf-scale`
  (~200–290× per obj, ~897k obj/s at 32 threads vs ~3.1k for real c2).
- **IL codec (K1/K2a)** — round-trip-gated typed-islands-over-opaque-spans
  model of `.ex`/`.gl`; float-leaf (`Box::Volume` shape) token vocabulary is
  typed; K3a length-consistent edits verified *as edits* against real c2.

**Staged but not yet ported** (fixtures/probes already in-repo, pointing at
the next classes):

- `il_bool_materialization.cpp` — integer comparisons → boolean (`x != 0`,
  `x > 7`, signed/unsigned).
- `select_max`, `shift_mask` in `add3.cpp` — ternary select, shifts, `&`.
- `mvp_fmul3.cpp` + `float_leaf_neighbors` test — float arithmetic leaves;
  the IL side already parses, codegen has no float registers.
- `il_call_return.cpp` — the call frontier: multi-arg calls, multiple calls,
  virtual calls, conditionals, locals, early returns.
- Out-of-class neighbor fixtures (`mvp_call_submod`, `…_twice`,
  `…_then_stmt`, …) — the fail-closed boundary is pinned by negative tests.

## 2. What "fully implemented" means here

The end state is **source→obj fully in-process, byte-exact, at port speed**:

```
PortC2(PortC1(foo.cpp)) == cl.exe /Ox /GS- /c foo.cpp     (timestamp zeroed)
```

for a stated, measured corpus — with no wibo, no process spawn, no `_CL_*`
files on disk. Concretely that means:

1. **Backend coverage**: the port accepts the function classes that actually
   occur in the target corpus (see G1), measured by the census tool (P2) —
   not "all of C++", which is unbounded (exceptions, RTTI, SEH, inline asm,
   template bloat). The coverage metric is the contract: a green run claims
   nothing outside it.
2. **Front-end coverage**: `c1-core` emits the 5-file bundle for the same
   source classes (Track D), so the composition needs no Microsoft binary in
   the loop at all.
3. **Throughput preserved**: the perf headline survives every widening step —
   each new class lands with a `perf` check, not just a byte check.

## 3. Gap analysis

### G1 — Backend class coverage (the main body of work)

The port is a **positive shape-matcher**: `c2-il::func::parse_segment`
accepts exactly the shapes it knows, codegen lowers them. The missing
classes, in intended working order (census may re-rank — see P2):

| # | Class | New mechanisms required | Staged? |
|---|-------|-------------------------|---------|
| W5 | **Multi-scratch expressions** (tree depth > 2, e.g. `(a+b)*(c+d)`) | COLOR scratch order beyond r11; operand-stack depth limit lifted | test-pinned reject |
| W6 | **Integer comparisons → bool** (`x!=0`, `x>7`, signed/unsigned) | `cmpwi`/`cmplwi`, cr bits, `subfe`/`addze` materialization idioms | `il_bool_materialization.cpp` |
| W7 | **Shifts + bitwise** (`<< >> & \| ^ ~`, mul-by-const strength reduction) | `slw`/`srw`/`sraw`/`rlwinm`/`andi.` (the dot!); non-commutative hazard list grows | `shift_mask` |
| W8 | **Control flow** (if/else, ternary select, loops) | multi-block `.ex` (labels, branch tokens), `bc`/`b`, block layout order, compare+branch fusion | `select_max`, `il_call_return` conditionals |
| W9 | **Division / modulo** | `divw`/`divwu`, remainder via `mullw`+`subf`; const divisor → multiply-high | — |
| W10 | **General frames + locals** (spills, local temps) | frame-size model beyond the fixed 96B, `lwz`/`stw` to frame, `.pdata` generalization; **must solve the `.pdata` label-counter shift (W-UNW-1)** | `cached_return` |
| W11 | **Calls generalized** (multi-arg, stack args, multiple calls/externals, multi-fn TUs with calls, calls in expressions) | arg registers r3–r10 + stack spill, call sequencing, `.pdata` per function (W-UNW-1 again), extern pairing beyond the single-external shortcut | `il_call_return.cpp` |
| W12 | **Memory / struct access** (pointers, member loads, stores, arrays) | `lwz`/`lhz`/`lbz`/`lha` + sign/zero extension, store forms, member-offset addressing — the `Box::Volume` float leaf lives here | float-leaf codec already typed |
| W13 | **Float codegen** (`fmul3` and friends) | f1–f13 params, `fmuls`/`fadds`/`fsubs`, `frsp`; float *constants* need `.rdata` + `lfs` + a data reloc (splits into 13a param-only leaves, 13b constants) | `mvp_fmul3.cpp` |
| W14 | **Data sections / globals** (`.data`/`.rdata`, string literals, statics, arrays) | new COFF sections, `ADDR32` relocs, symbol storage classes | — |

Long tail, census-driven only: switch/jump tables, 64-bit ints (`addc`/`adde`
carry chains), unsigned variants everywhere, virtual/indirect calls (needs
W12 + `mtctr`/`bctrl`), `__declspec`s, intrinsics. Do not schedule these
ahead of measured demand.

### G2 — IL decode coverage

`func.rs` is a positive parser for a handful of shapes; the general `.ex`
grammar (comparisons `24`, shifts `09`, bitwise `0B`, ternary `43 42`, branch
tokens, labels, …) is still opaque, as are the `.ex` header/index region, the
FnHeader interior, most of `.gl`, and **all of `.sy`/`.in`/`.db`** (coverage
map: `IL_BUNDLE_MVP.md`). Each W-step decodes exactly the grammar it needs
(codec-first, round-trip gated); `.sy` (symbol/type table) becomes
load-bearing around W12–W14 when sizes and types stop being inferable from
`.ex` alone.

### G3 — Front-end port (`c1xx.dll` → `c1-core`)

Scoped in the FE plan (memory: `frontend-port-roadmap`); replay proof landed.

- **P-F0.2** — characterization probes: which argv tokens affect bundle bytes
  (expect only `-f`), line-number → `.db` deltas, comment/whitespace
  sensitivity → `docs/FE_BUNDLE_MVP.md`.
- **P-F1** — `c1-core` crate, `Frontend` trait, std-only lexer/recognizer for
  the backend MVP class. `.in` is a class constant, `.ex` via the codec's
  encode side, `.sy`/`.gl`/`.db` from observed record patterns + a trivial
  name mangler + the lowercased `-f` path. Grade 1: `PortC1 == captured` per
  file; Grade 2: `PortC2(PortC1(src)) == pipeline obj`.
- **P-F2** — widen in lockstep with the backend's accepted class; `perf-fe`.

Key risk: `.db` line-record semantics (smallest, least understood); any
preprocessor use leaves the class — the recognizer must fail closed.

### G4 — Architecture: shape-matcher → general lowering

`c2-core::passes` is an empty module tree; `paint/` holds Ghidra+LLM
first-draft Rust of the COLOR register allocator (scaffolding, not truth,
gitignored). The port does **not** need to reimplement c2's 35-pass
optimizer — the doctrine is I/O-behavioral, so only the *observable effects*
on emitted bytes matter, per accepted class. The architectural question is
when the accreting shape-matcher gets restructured into a real
IL→lower→emit pipeline. Answer: not yet — keep widening the matcher until
the CFG step (W8) and frames (W10) force a block/instruction IR, then
restructure `codegen` around it, keeping every differential gate green.
COLOR knowledge lands when W5/W10 demand real register-order modeling.

### G5 — Coverage measurement (the instrument is landing)

Today there is no published number for "how much of real code does the port
accept". The corpus generator makes synthetic triples; `stuck-dc3` probes
poked at one real function. The measuring tool is emerging as **`c2rs gap`**
(real-workload gap scan, in-flight at time of writing): run the whole
pipeline — capture with the project's real flags → port → byte compare — over
real dc3 TUs, bucketing each into `capture-fail` / `vocab-gap` /
`codegen-gap` (keyed by the port's own `NotImplemented` reason) / `mismatch`
/ `match`, with JSONL records for longitudinal diffing and a
`--replay-every N` soundness lane extending P0.1 to real workloads.
`scripts/gen_dc3_workload.sh` generates the inputs from a dc3-decomp
checkout. What remains for this gap to close: a committed baseline scan, the
coverage % promoted to the headline metric, and the histogram wired into the
widening loop (every W-step re-ranks it; coverage must be monotone).

### G6 — Harness experiments maturity

`retrieve`/`search`/lifter-eval are prototypes riding the harness. They are
not the port and need no maturation for the stack goal; leave them, but keep
them out of the port's critical path.

## 4. Strategy

1. **Demand-driven widening.** P2 (census) before W5+. Every W-step is chosen
   by measured frequency, not intuition, and verified to move the number.
2. **The per-class recipe** (the loop W1–W4 already followed — every class
   lands the same way):
   1. Stage minimal `.cpp` fixtures: positive shapes *and* negative neighbors.
   2. `c2rs capture` + reference-compile; byte-classify the obj
      (CONST/DERIVED) in the relevant `docs/` doc.
   3. Extend the codec / positive parser to accept exactly the new shape —
      fail closed on the neighbors.
   4. Extend codegen + coff (new sections/relocs as needed).
   5. Gate: `c2rs diff` byte-exact on all positives, `NotImplemented` on all
      negatives, `cargo test --workspace` green, `c2rs perf` re-confirmed.
   6. Re-run the census: coverage up, no regressions, histogram re-ranked.
   7. Doc the class (extend `CODEGEN_PPC_MVP.md` / `IL_BUNDLE_MVP.md` or a
      new doc), update `fixtures/README.md`.
3. **Two-speed decode.** The round-trip codec (typed islands over opaque
   spans) generalizes ahead of the parser, so each W-step inherits tokenized
   grammar instead of raw bytes. Never weaken the round-trip gate to land a
   class.
4. **FE in parallel once P-F1 lands.** The backend ladder and the FE track
   share exactly one interface — the bundle — so they can widen in lockstep
   without blocking each other.
5. **Composition is the milestone that matters.** A `c2rs compose` subcommand
   (source→obj in-process, byte-exact, timed) is the demo that the stack is
   real; everything before it is enabling work.

## 5. The phases, in order

```
P2    census baseline with `c2rs gap` (dc3 workload) (G5; the driver)
W5    multi-scratch expressions                     (unblocks expression shapes)
W6    integer comparisons → bool                    (staged; small; frequent)
W7    shifts + bitwise + strength reduction         (staged)
W8    control flow (if/else, ternary, loops)        (first CFG; IR restructure)
W9    division / modulo
W10   general frames + locals (+ .pdata labels W-UNW-1)
W11   calls generalized (+ W-UNW-1 for multi-fn TUs)
W12   memory / struct access
W13   float codegen (13a param-only, 13b constants→.rdata)
W14   data sections / globals
P-F0.2 FE characterization probes → FE_BUNDLE_MVP.md   (parallel track)
P-F1  c1-core MVP + Grade-1/2 gates                    (parallel track)
P-F2  FE widening in lockstep + perf-fe                (parallel track)
P3    c2rs compose — source→obj in-process, byte-exact + perf-fe scale
```

W8 is the pivot: it forces the block/instruction IR, the `.ex` branch
grammar, and compare/branch fusion. Everything after it is easier to
schedule but harder to keep honest — more of the obj becomes derived, so the
CONST/DERIVED classification discipline matters more per step, not less.

## 6. Next actions (this week-scale)

1. **P2**: land the in-flight `c2rs gap` scan, run the dc3 workload baseline
   (`scripts/gen_dc3_workload.sh` → `c2rs gap`), and commit the headline
   numbers (match %, the ranked `codegen-gap` reasons, any `vocab-gap` /
   `mismatch`). The ranked reason list *is* the widening order — expect it to
   re-rank W5–W14 below.
2. **W5**: lift the depth-2 stack limit using the documented COLOR scratch
   order; positive fixture `(a+b)*(c+d)`, negative depth-5 tree.
3. **P-F0.2**: argv/line-number/whitespace probes → `docs/FE_BUNDLE_MVP.md`.
4. Re-rank W6+ from the first census histogram; update this doc.

## 7. Invariants (do not break)

- **Real c2 is the sole judge** — `port(IL) == c2(IL)` byte-exact, timestamp
  zeroed. The port never grades itself; no mocks, no fuzzy gates.
- **Fail closed** — outside the accepted class: `NotImplemented`, never a
  mis-emit. Negative-neighbor fixtures are as load-bearing as positive ones.
- **Coverage-bounded honesty** — a green run claims the tested corpus only;
  the census number is the public claim.
- **std-only, zero external crates**; toolchain-absent degrades to clean SKIP.
- **Nothing binary committed** — no IL (`_CL_*`, `*.il`), no objs, no machine
  paths, no MS binaries; only fixture `.cpp` and docs.
- **Commit small and often**, verified; never push unless asked.
